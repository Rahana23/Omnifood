# Omnifood

## Project Overview

We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want to solve this by using AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and get a personalized diet plan that fits their needs. The app will also help users track their progress and make changes to their diet as needed. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cookin partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users canchoose between recieving one or two meals per day,every single day of the month.
